Make Custom MySQL Table In Selected Database
Python program to create table on select mysql database. Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database. I recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector". PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment. If not install pip from https://pypi.org/project/pip/ To install "MySQL Connector" run this command :
>> pip install mysql-connector-python
>> 
If you want to make custom Configuration, uncomment line 2,3,4,7,8,9,21,22,23 and comment lines 10,11,12,24,25,26.
